# Employee Tracker

## This Repository

This repository is where I am working on an employee tracker as an assignment for a coding bootcamp. This was assigned during the SQL unit of the course. The application is a Content Management System built from scratch. A schema file is used to create a company_db with tables for departments, roles, and employees. The application uses Inquirer to access the database through the CLI. 

## Usage

This application uses MySQL, Node.js, and Inquirer v8.2.4. Run the application with 'node index.js'. A main menu will be presented. Navigate the options with arrow keys. Select an option and follow the prompts to view, write, or update data. Deletion is not yet available because it is not a requirement for the assignment.
